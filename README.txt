On the index page, you will see a counter and a temperature. The counter is being generated by js found in counter.js. 
The temperature is being pulled from an api found in api.js.
The navigation is responsive and is built by javascript. You can find the code for the navigation in nav.js.

How to use the website:

1. Go to navigation and select "teams generator"
2. type in how many teams you have (up to 20)
3. name each of your teams
4. Once you submit your teams, you will be taken to the bracket page with a prefilled bracket including your teams.
5. you can now input scores and drag teams to advance them.

The tournament bracket uses local storage to store the team names and their rank.

Please note that the tournament bracket page is not responsive. this is on purpose because if the tournament 
bracket shrank, it would be too small to read.
